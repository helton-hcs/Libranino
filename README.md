# Libranino
Arduino libraries that I came up with while playing with Arduino stuff.

The libraries are all **header-only**, which means that you just have to include them on your sketches and you'll be ready to go! (*piece of cake, isn't it?*)

## Installation
Just clone the Libranino into your Arduino libraries folder:

`git clone https://github.com/helton-hcs/Libranino.git ~/Arduino/libraries`.
